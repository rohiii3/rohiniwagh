I am an undergraduate student at MIT Manipal, pursuing Engineering in Mathematics and Computing. My academic interests lie in machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a focus on building data-driven solutions for real-world problems. I enjoy working at the intersection of mathematics, computation, and practical applications, and I am actively developing my skills through projects and collaborative work.
